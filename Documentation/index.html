		<h3 id="copying"><strong>D) Copy Files</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Unzip the file you downloaded from CodeCanyon, copy the contents in the folder called Washbook and paste them in your desired directory where you want to install the system.</p>
		<h3 id="folder" style="color: red;"><strong>D.1) Installing in a folder</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<h3>D.2)</h3>



<p>Open <strong><em>routes.php</em></strong> files located inside the <em><strong>src</strong></em> folder and you will see a commented out line of code that looks like the one below</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>// 'prefix' => '/' . env('URL_PREFIX'),</code></pre>

		<h3 id="database"><strong>E) Import Database</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>When you unzipped the file in step 1, there is a folder called database you will find. In there you will find an SQL file, that is the system database. Import it to your PhPMyAdmin or whatever system you use. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rt3Ru9-LHnY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Watch this video</strong></a> if you are new to importing SQL databases.</p>

		<h3 id="complete"><strong>I) Access the System</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Access the system by visiting your APP_URL which you had set on the env settings above and login using the credentials provide in the <strong>credentials.txt</strong> file.  Now you are all set! Cheers 🙂</p>
		
		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="html"><strong>J) HTML & Code Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This system is a fixed layout with one column. All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with a class of "container". The header is nested inside the "header" tag</p>

		<p>The system is built on a simple PHP Framework all view files are under views folder and included files such as sidebar, header, footer & email templates files are under views/includes folder, controllers and function files are in the src folder. All uploads go to the uploads folder. </p>

		<p>There are many design patterns when it comes to writing PHP applications. With this product, we chose the MVC pattern coupled with a singleton service container. The following is the application tree structure that is relevant to PHP:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>/config - this folder contains the application's configuration files by category.</li>
			<li>/lang - This folder stores all human language folders in standardized format. For example, the en_US folder here would contain language files specific to the English language denoted by its two digit code en and the region USA denoted by its two digit country code US.</li>
			<li>/src - Within this folder are:-
				<ol>
					<li>the main Simcify classes (like the /src/Application.php file)</li>
					<li>/Controllers - this folder contains route controller classes
						<ul>
							<li>/Controller.php - this is the parent controller class which should be extended by all controllers.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>/Exceptions - this is where all custom exceptions that Simcify uses
						<ul>
							<li>/Handler.php - this file handles all exeptions thrown by Simcify after routing has been started.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>/helpers.php - helper function declarations that are available throughout the entire application</li>
					<li>/Middleware - this contains routing middleware classes</li>
					<li>/routes.php - these are route declarations for the application</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li>/views - contains the application views/layouts in HTML or plain text format
				<ol>
					<li>/compiled - contains all compiled views and is only used internally by Simcify</li>
					<li>/emails - contains views specific to emails sent out by the application
						<ul>
							<li>/html - holds the html body versions of an email</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>/errors - contains views that the application uses when an error has been encountered. They are named by their respective HTTP status codes. A slight note here, if a request is detected as an AJAX request, you are expected to give your own responses when errors occur. These views are only rendered on normal HTTP requests.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Any other folders can be added in here for customisation if your application design requires so. You are free to add more.</p>

		<h3 id="csscode"><strong>K) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>Washbook uses two CSS files in this system. The first one is a bootstrap. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a bootstrap CSS file, we can work round this. This file also contains many styling of most elements and layouts, such as anchor tag colors, font-sizes, buttons, typography, etc. Keep in mind, that some of these values are overridden in the second file.</p> 

		<p>The second file contains all of the specific stylings for Washbook System. The file is separated into sections.The first sections is for styling larger screens and the second section is for smaller devices for responsivenes</p>  

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="jscode"><strong>L) JavaScript</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>

		<h3 id="phpcode"><strong>M) PHP code  </strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>Washbook uses PHP exclusively for server side coding, all view files are under views folder and included files such as sidebar, header, footer & email templates files are under views/includes folder, controllers and function files are in the src folder. There is one major file to take note of;</p>
		
			<ol>
				<li>Routes - /src/routes.php</li>
			</ol>
		
		<p>If you'd like to change the routes, open "/src/routes.php", make the necessary adjustments, and then save the file. This file holds all the paths of the system so be careful when editting it. Below are some example of paths created for each method type;</p> 

		<code>
			Router::get('/example1/', 'Example@example1');<br>
			Router::post('/example2/', 'Example@example2');<br>
			Router::delete('/example3/', 'Example@example3');<br>
			Router::put('/example4/', 'Example@example4');
		</code>

		<p>Full documentation on this routing library can be found here <a href="https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router" target="_blank">https://github.com/skipperbent/simple-php-router</a></p>


		<h3>Environment Variables</h3>
		<p>To retrieve environment variables from .env, we have provided a helper function env. Usage is described below:</p>
		<code>mixed env( string $variable_name [, mixed $default_value = null ])</code>

		<h3>Configuration Files</h3>

		<p>At the root of this projects directory structure there is a directory named config. This folder stores config values categorised by file name e.g. All authentication configuration variables will be stored in auth.php.</p>
		<p>Configurations stored in this files may also be extracted  from the environment variables and it is recommended that all environment variables have a corresponding config variable. This is because unlike environment variables which are declared only once and are not mutable, config variables are mutable and can be changed during the run-time of a request.</p>
		<p>To retrieve config variables or set them during run-time, we have provided an helper function  config which acts as a getter/setter polymorphic function. Usage is described below:</p>

		<code>mixed config( string$key [, mixed $value = null ])</code>
